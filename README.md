2) Automation performed the tasks of       
      - Calculating the difference in the net profit between each day. If the net profit is not consecutively higher each day, the programme will highlight the day where Net Profit is lower than the previous day and the value difference.       
      - Calculating the difference in Cash-On-Hand between each day. If Cash-On-Hand is not consecutively higher each day, the programme will highlight the day where Cash-On-Hand is lower than the previous day and the value difference.       
      - Finding the highest overhead category and itâ€™s value.   
 
 The programme will then convert the above tasks using the real time exchange rate from the API call & write the computed amount to a text file, summary_report.txt
